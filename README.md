Coursework for 2017/18. RSA encryption messaging application using Java Swing.
This is for the programming cousework for the AQA exam board for the years of 2017/18. This program is meant to take you a year, along with documentation of each part of the process (design/implementation/etc).

I have decided to make an encrypted messaging application that uses the RSA encryption algorithm, this algorithm is cryptographically secure provided the original prime numbers that you start with are secure, and are not generated through a system clock, or any other calcuable thing.
